            <p>Play or Pay is an event that started years ago inside 2 groups: Beardtopia and The Quips. It used to be run by an awesome person called Erdbeertoertchen, but after they decided to quit, the event stopped happening.</p>

            <p>Since all of us loved it, we decided to bring it back!!!</p>
